# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EclairCP is a Python-based CLI tool designed to test and interact with remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The tool provides an elegant, session-based interface that allows developers to quickly connect to MCP servers, test their functionality, and interact with them through a streaming conversation interface powered by Strands agents. The tool emphasizes ease of use, real-time feedback, and efficient testing workflows for MCP server development and integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with MCP servers, I want to quickly test remote MCP server connections and functionality, so that I can validate server implementations and debug integration issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `eclaircp` THEN the system SHALL start an interactive CLI session
2. WHEN the user provides a configuration file with MCP server specifications THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the server connection details
3. WHEN the user selects an MCP server to connect to THEN the system SHALL establish a connection and display connection status
4. IF a connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
5. WHEN connected to an MCP server THEN the system SHALL allow the user to test available tools and functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have conversational interactions with MCP servers through a Strands-powered agent, so that I can test complex workflows and see real-time responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a message in the CLI session THEN the system SHALL process it through the Strands agent with streaming responses
2. WHEN the agent generates a response THEN the system SHALL display it with real-time streaming output
3. WHEN the session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context using Strands built-in session management
4. WHEN the user exits the session THEN the system SHALL clean up without persisting conversation history to files
5. WHEN the agent needs to call MCP tools THEN the system SHALL execute them against the connected MCP server and display results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure MCP server connections through a specification file, so that I can easily switch between different servers and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a configuration file THEN the system SHALL read MCP server specifications including connection details, authentication, and metadata
2. WHEN multiple servers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select which server to connect to
3. WHEN server configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with specific details
4. IF no configuration file is provided THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to create one or provide connection details interactively
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL reload and apply them without requiring a restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive help and usage information, so that I can quickly understand how to use the tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `eclaircp --help` THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage instructions
2. WHEN help is displayed THEN it SHALL include examples of configuration files, common commands, and troubleshooting tips
3. WHEN the user is in an interactive session THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help commands
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN the user types help commands during a session THEN the system SHALL display available MCP tools and their descriptions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to follow Python best practices and be easily installable, so that I can integrate it into my development workflow seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL use uv for dependency management and packaging
2. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL be formatted with pyink and validated with pylint and isort
3. WHEN the tool is installed THEN it SHALL be available as a command-line executable
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL include appropriate CLI/TUI libraries for elegant user interaction
5. WHEN the project is distributed THEN it SHALL include proper setup configuration for easy installation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want elegant and responsive user interface interactions, so that testing MCP servers feels smooth and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL use event streaming to display content as it's produced
2. WHEN the user interacts with the CLI THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN long operations are running THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN displaying structured data THEN the system SHALL format it clearly with proper syntax highlighting
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with clear visual distinction from normal output
